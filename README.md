    ```bash
    cd gyft-backend
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `gyft-backend` folder to store environment variables:

    ```bash
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/gyft?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    PORT=5000
    ```

4. Start the backend:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node src/server.ts
    ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

    ```bash
    cd ../gyft-frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Backend

The backend for Gyft is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It handles user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints for managing wish lists.

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /gifts`: Create a new gift.
- `GET /gifts`: Retrieve the list of gifts for the authenticated user.
- `GET /friends/:friendId/wishlists`: View a friend's wish list.

### Mongoose Models

- **User**: Stores user information such as phone number and authentication details.
- **Gift**: Represents each gift a user wants to receive, including the title, description, and occasion.

## Frontend

The frontend of Gyft is built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It communicates with the backend via API calls to display user wish lists and friends' wish lists.

### Key Features

- **User Interface**: Users can log in, view, and manage their wish lists.
- **Friends Integration**: Users can view their friends' wish lists and invite others to join.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend, simply navigate to the `gyft-frontend` folder and use `npm start` to start the development server.

```bash
cd gyft-frontend
npm start
```
